### Project Name:
**Tensorflow AIML Object Detection**

---

### GitHub Project Description:

Tensorflow AIML Object Detection is an advanced, real-time object detection and aimbot tool designed to enhance gameplay precision. Leveraging TensorFlow's CenterNet object detection model, this project allows for the identification and tracking of objects (e.g., players) within a game environment and automates targeting and mouse movement to optimize in-game performance.

The tool is highly customizable, with configurable global variables for detection thresholds, mouse movement scaling, and frame rates, making it adaptable to various games. Built with an emphasis on efficiency, Tensorflow AIML Object Detection includes logging, error handling, and optimization to ensure reliable performance during gameplay.

**Features**:
- Real-time object detection using TensorFlow
- Customizable detection and mouse movement parameters
- Advanced error handling and in-depth logging for reliability
- Multi-threading support for improved performance
- Adaptable to various games (e.g., CS:GO, Fortnite, etc.)

# Tensorflow AIML Object Detection

Tensorflow AIML Object Detection is a Python-based project using TensorFlow and AI-driven object detection to enhance gameplay precision by automatically targeting detected objects in real time.

## Features
- **AI Object Detection**: Utilizes TensorFlow's CenterNet model to detect and track objects in a game environment.
- **Customizable**: Easily adjustable global parameters for object detection sensitivity, scaling, and mouse movement.
- **Real-Time**: Works in real-time to track the closest object and adjust mouse movement accordingly.
- **Cross-Game Support**: Built for multiple games like CS:GO and Fortnite (customizable window detection).
- **Error Handling & Logging**: Provides detailed logs and error handling for maximum reliability.

## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (`tensorflow` and `tensorflow_hub`)
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- PyAutoGUI (`pyautogui`)
- Win32 API (`pywin32`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)

Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow_hub opencv-python pyautogui pywin32 numpy
```

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Tensorflow-AIML-Object-Detection.git
cd Tensorflow-AIML-Object-Detection
```

2. **Modify Global Variables**:

You can adjust the global variables in the script for different game setups:

```python
# Configuration Variables
WINDOW_NAME = 'Counter-Strike: Global Offensive'  # Name of the game window
MODEL_URL = "https://tfhub.dev/tensorflow/centernet/resnet50v1_fpn_512x512/1"  # TensorFlow model URL
SCORE_THRESHOLD = 0.5   # Confidence score threshold for detection
FRAME_SKIP = 1          # Skip every n frames to reduce CPU/GPU load
SIZE_SCALE = 3          # Scale for reducing screenshot size
AIM_SMOOTHNESS = 1.7    # Control the speed of mouse movements
```

3. **Running the Project**:

To run the project, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The program will:
- Detect the target window (e.g., CS:GO) and take screenshots.
- Use TensorFlow's AI model to detect objects (e.g., players).
- Automatically move the mouse to the closest detected object and simulate mouse clicks.

4. **Adjusting for Different Games**:

To switch between games (like CS:GO and Fortnite), you can update the `WINDOW_NAME` variable in the script. For example, if you're playing Fortnite:

```python
WINDOW_NAME = 'UnrealWindow'
```

5. **Logging and Error Handling**:

This project has in-depth logging to help you understand how the object detection and mouse movements are working. If there is an issue during runtime, it will be logged in detail.

Logs will be stored in `logs/` with detailed timestamps and error information.
